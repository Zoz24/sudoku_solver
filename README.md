# Sudoku Solver
This project uses python to create a program that solves Sudoku questions. The method I used is recursion and backtracking.

  <h3>How run the code?</h3>
  <p> 
  This program was created with python which is a popular programming language. Make sure you have python downloaded.
  You can run the code either from a terminal, a code editor(such as visual studio code), or an IDE(such as Pycharm).
  </p>
  <p> 
  If you want to run the code from your terminal, use "mkdir" to create a folder, then store "sudoku.py" within that folder,
  then type in "python sudoku.py" to run the code. If you use a code editor or IDE, you can run the code within the software.
